[1.04s – 12.16s] Hello everyone, welcome to the channel where we review paid apps that are free today. Our focus is StudyX, a flashcard and homework AI.
[13.53s – 42.54s] Billed as the best AI Math Helper, the app offers homework help for any subject, generates similar questions, provides step-by-step explanations, quiz challenges, Photomath-level AI tutoring, and StudyX flashcards.
[43.78s – 62.62s] Scrolling to the bottom of the page, the Premium Unlimited option still shows a price of $34. However, once we install the app, it should activate for free.
[64.00s – 67.56s] I’ll pause the video to install the app and then come right back.
[67.90s – 75.55s] I’m back—installation finished. Let’s test it. Opening the app now.
[77.78s – 86.79s] The lifetime license is free today.
[87.73s – 93.56s] I’ll pause to activate it by entering my Apple ID.
[93.88s – 99.34s] When you open the app, it prompts you to sign in.
[99.69s – 100.61s] I’ve signed in.
[100.95s – 107.37s] We’ll sign in with Apple, which lets us hide our email address.
[108.15s – 114.02s] It asks what subjects you need help with—math, science, English, history, and programming.
[114.78s – 139.53s] I’ll choose programming and math only. Let’s continue with college-level topics and see how it goes.
[140.83s – 152.99s] You can take a picture of a problem and the app will guide you through it. For now, let’s skip ahead.
[153.79s – 172.20s] Here are some customer reviews. We’ll proceed by tapping Continue. Next, we’ll rate the app—giving it five stars. Let’s move on.
[173.48s – 175.79s] We gave it a five-star rating.
[176.21s – 180.49s] We did that since we’re getting the app for free today.
[183.15s – 200.99s] Let’s keep going. For now, I’ll tap “Proceed” and deny camera access, since I don’t have homework to scan.
[201.97s – 206.55s] In Settings, we can see a few options.
[207.63s – 208.57s] I prefer dark mode, so I’m turning that on.
[208.81s – 232.39s] I’ll set my experience level. I didn’t grant camera permission, but the app provides sample homework—great. I’ll likely review this app in more detail next time, since it works best when you capture homework problems.
[232.65s – 242.76s] Today, I mainly wanted to show how to get the app for free.
[244.04s – 247.24s] The sample homework shows Calculus: finding the area between two curves.
[248.62s – 250.73s] Let me go back.
[251.25s – 259.20s] Going back again takes me to the camera. I don’t have any homework to scan right now.
[259.98s – 263.78s] Opening the History view…
[264.54s – 270.97s] We can see questions we previously got help with.
[271.82s – 282.07s] That’s it, folks. Don’t forget to subscribe for daily reviews of paid apps that go free for the day. Thanks for watching! We’ll catch you in the next video.
