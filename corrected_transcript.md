[87.73s - 93.56s] Let me pause and just activate this app by entering my Apple ID and then I'll be back.

[93.88s - 99.34s] Okay, I did activate the app, it did not ask for my Apple ID, but I had to sign in.

[99.69s - 100.61s] I did sign in to use the app.

[101.03s - 107.37s] I used Apple to sign into the app, since Apple allows me to hide my email.

[108.15s - 114.02s] We can see here, what subject do you need help with? We have math, science, English, History, programming.

[114.78s - 139.53s] All the options seemed selected. I want only programming and math. Okay, let's continue. And let's say college level. It is asking my experience level, I will say yes, I do have experience.

[140.83s - 147.16s] Here, we could take a picture of any problem and the app will help us, but I will continue since I don't have any homework at the moment.

[147.92s - 152.99s] Now, it is suggesting to try it first, but I will skip.

[153.79s - 172.20s] Here, you have feedback from some of their customers. We can just continue. Okay, we'll rate the app for today. We'll just give them five stars since we are getting the app for free today.

[172.52s - 175.79s] I am back after rating the app. Okay, we did give them a five star.

[176.21s - 180.51s] Let's proceed because they're giving us the app free today.

[183.15s - 201.79s] Let's continue. And for now, I will say don't allow, just proceed because I don't have any homework to scan.

[201.97s - 206.55s] If I go here in the settings, we can see a few things.

[208.81s - 232.39s] I like the dark mode. Okay, I said my experience level and I didn't give it permission. So. Yeah, I think I'm going to review this app in in-depth next time because I had to actually take a picture of a problem before the app can help me.

[232.65s - 242.76s] I just wanted to show you guys how to get the app for free. Oh, nice the app came back with some sample problems.
